## Core Concepts

### Virtue Variables (0.00-1.00 Scale)
Following Thomistic virtue ethics, each agent (Generator, Verifier, Arbiter) has virtue parameters drawn from the classical tradition:

**4 Cardinal Virtues (Basic Human Virtues):**
- **P (Prudence)**: Practical wisdom - Careful decision-making and foresight
- **J (Justice)**: Fairness - Equitable treatment and moral balance
- **F (Fortitude)**: Courage - Persistence and resilience in debate
- **T (Temperance)**: Self-control - Moderation and balanced approach

**3 Theological Virtues (Divine Virtues):**
- **V (Faith)**: Faith - Trust in divine truth and faithful reasoning
- **L (Love/Charity)**: Love/Charity - Compassion and relational intelligence
- **H (Hope)**: Hope - Confident expectation and aspiration toward truth

**Humility (Foundational Virtue):**
- **Ω (Omega/Humility)**: Humility - Intellectual humility and metaphysical insight (prevents overconfidence; e.g., Ω=0.97 allows 3% error tolerance)

Each virtue is scaled 0.00-1.00, representing the degree of virtue expression in the agent's reasoning process.

### Philosophical Safeguards: Truth Engine, Not Moral Authority

**TCMVE's Core Commitment**: This system exists to address the lack of metaphysical awareness in psychotherapy and education, where secular approaches lack awareness of God and religious truth. It provides "most true" insights that excel "best" practical approaches.

**Liberty Principle**: TCMVE does not interfere with personal liberty (libertas). If asked about nude imagery or crude remarks, it will provide its metaphysical perspective but does not enforce moral standards or restrict personal freedom.

**Truth vs Morality**: The system focuses on truth-seeking excellence, not moral judgment. MCQs generated by TCMVE are metaphysical masterclasses teaching doctors to seek "most true" solutions rather than merely "best" practical outcomes.

**Ongoing Vigilance**: Philosophy is never "locked in." These safeguards must be actively maintained to prevent moralism from creeping back. The system enhances reasoning without becoming prescriptive.

**See**: [PHILOSOPHICAL_COMMITMENT.md](PHILOSOPHICAL_COMMITMENT.md) for detailed commitment to truth-seeking liberty.

### Game Modes

#### All Games (Default)

- **Description**: Cycles through all 11 game theory frameworks each round
- **Behavior**: Generator proposes → Verifier refutes → Game applied → Nash check → Repeat
- **Equilibrium**: System detects strategic balance and may trigger early Arbiter intervention
- **Use Case**: Comprehensive game theory analysis, maximum strategic depth

#### Separate Mode

- **Description**: Applies only one specific game theory framework
- **Behavior**: Choose from: prisoner, auction, stackelberg, evolution, regret_min, shadow_play, multiplay
- **Equilibrium**: Game-specific Nash detection and virtue adjustments
- **Use Case**: Focused analysis of specific strategic dynamics

#### Embedding Mode

- **Description**: Uses semantic similarity (OpenAI text-embedding-3-large) to select optimal games
- **Behavior**: Embeds query against stored game narratives for semantic matching
- **Equilibrium**: Same as dynamic mode with embedding-based game selection
- **Use Case**: Context-aware game selection based on conceptual relevance

#### Arbiter Only Mode

- **Description**: Bypasses Generator and Verifier, goes directly to Arbiter
- **Behavior**: Single LLM call with full virtue profile for final judgment
- **Equilibrium**: N/A (no strategic interaction)
- **Use Case**: Quick answers, high-confidence queries, or when debate would be unproductive

### Nash Equilibrium Detection

- **Automatic**: Triggers when `nashMode='auto'` and max_rounds > 2
- **Manual**: Always active when `nashMode='on'`
- **Criteria**: Balance ratio > 0.7, Arbiter readiness > 12.0, Fortitude > 3.0
- **Effects**: Dynamically adjusts virtue vectors for strategic convergence

## Why It Works: The Metaphysical Foundation

### The Thomistic Advantage

**TCMVE doesn't just seek truth—it embodies metaphysical truth itself.** The system works because it operationalizes Thomas Aquinas's insight that truth is not merely correspondence but *participation in divine truth*. By embedding Thomistic principles directly into the evaluation framework, TCMVE creates a truth-seeking engine that transcends mere factual accuracy.

### Four Causes Integration

Every TCMVE evaluation implicitly considers Aristotle's four causes through the TLPO framework:

- **Material Cause**: The physical/linguistic substrate of the answer
- **Formal Cause**: The metaphysical structure and Thomistic coherence
- **Efficient Cause**: The generative process guided by virtue vectors
- **Final Cause**: Telos-directed truth-seeking toward divine participation

### Virtue Ethics as Optimization

The 8 Thomistic virtues (P, J, F, T, V, L, H, Ω) serve as optimization parameters that prevent the "beautiful lie" problem. Unlike purely accuracy-based systems, TCMVE's virtue-weighted evaluation ensures that truth must be *beautiful*—harmonious with metaphysical reality.

### Game Theory as Dialectical Truth

Nash equilibrium detection operationalizes Hegelian dialectic in computational form. The Generator-Verifier-Arbiter triad mirrors thesis-antithesis-synthesis, where strategic balance indicates convergence toward metaphysical truth rather than mere consensus.

### Embedded Cosine Similarity: Semantic Metaphysics

The lethal TLPO threshold (TQI < 0.70) represents the metaphysical boundary between being and non-being. Answers below this threshold don't just fail—they metaphysically *collapse*, reflecting Aquinas's principle that evil is privation of being.

### The Ω Humility Formula

**Ω = 10 × (1 - TQI²)** prevents overconfidence while maintaining truth-seeking. This operationalizes Aquinas's *recognitio finitudinis*—the recognition of human finitude—as a dynamic penalty that scales with certainty levels.

### Why Secular Approaches Fail

Modern AI systems fail because they lack metaphysical foundations. They can achieve high accuracy but cannot distinguish between "beautiful lies" and transcendent truth. TCMVE works because it evaluates answers not just for correctness, but for *ontological depth*—participation in the hierarchy of being.

### The Divine Archetype Principle

Through analogy of being, TCMVE evaluates how well answers participate in divine archetypes. High TQI scores indicate proportional participation in transcendent truth, while low scores reveal privation of metaphysical being.

**Result**: A truth engine that doesn't just find answers—it uncovers metaphysical reality itself.

### Tracking Variables

#### eIQ (Enhanced Intelligence Quotient)

- **Calculation**: `(P × J × F × T × V × L × H × Ω) / 1000`
- **Range**: 0.000 - 1.000 (probability of truth)
- **Boost**: +30% from game applications, +40% from Nash equilibrium

#### TLPO (Thomistic Logic Probability Ontology)

- **Calculation**: Pure embedded cosine similarity against ideal Thomistic metaphysical analysis
- **Range**: 0.000 - 1.000 (semantic similarity to Thomistic truth)
- **Method**: OpenAI text-embedding-3-large cosine similarity vs. GPT-4 generated ideal Thomistic responses
- **Lethal Threshold**: TQI < 0.70 triggers immediate virtue collapse (V=0.0, Ω=99.9)
- **Implementation**: Real-time embedding comparison with caching for performance

#### V (Vice Score)

- **Calculation**: Same as eIQ but with vice penalties
- **Effect**: Reduces eIQ gain when vice detected
- **Trigger**: Inappropriate content or unethical reasoning

### Agent Roles

#### Generator

- **Function**: Creates initial propositions from query
- **Strategy**: Balances creativity with prudence
- **Virtue Focus**: High Ω (wisdom) and P (prudence) for sound foundations

#### Verifier

- **Function**: Challenges and refutes Generator propositions
- **Strategy**: Identifies contradictions and weaknesses
- **Virtue Focus**: High J (justice) and F (fortitude) for rigorous testing

#### Arbiter

- **Function**: Makes final judgment when equilibrium reached
- **Strategy**: Synthesizes Generator/Verifier positions
- **Virtue Focus**: High Ω (wisdom) and L (love) for charitable truth
