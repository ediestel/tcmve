**Eckhart Diestel**  

## I. Ontological Premise  
Intelligence has historically been construed as an intrinsic, self-contained potency—actualized in isolation and quantified via static benchmarks (Binet, 1905; Wechsler, 1939). This framework assumes cognition as *ens per se*, bounded by neurobiological limits. Contemporary large language models (LLMs) compel a reevaluation: intelligence emerges not as solitary act but as *actus in relatione*, a participatory extension of rational agency through artificial substrates.  

We propose **effective IQ (eIQ)** as the ontological actuality of man-machine cognitive communion—the measurable performance of a dyadic system wherein the man&#x27;s intentionality directs and refines machine-mediated reasoning. eIQ is not additive; it is *transitive being*: the man remains the formal and final cause, while the LLM serves as instrumental cause in a unified teleological act. Here, **biological IQ (bIQ)** denotes the unaided potency inherent to the man&#x27;s native constitution.

## II. From Potency to Distributed Act  
Traditional IQ assesses unaided potency. eIQ actualizes a higher-order potency latent in the structure of mindedness itself: the capacity for recursive self-externalization.  

- A logician posits; the system enumerates proofs.  
- A linguist queries; the system transduces across tongues.  
- A strategist models; the system simulates branching worlds.  

This is not delegation but *co-actualization*. The man retains finality (telos); the machine amplifies materiality (scale, speed, memory). No primary eIQ datasets exist—yet the phenomenon demands systematic inquiry.

### The Archer Analogy: eIQ as Inert Ability of the Man  
Consider the archer who strikes the target: praise accrues primarily to the archer for his intent, judgment, and mastery of the act, not to the bow and arrow as independent agents. The instruments are inert extensions of potency, actualized only through the man&#x27;s directing form. So too with eIQ—the LLM, as bow and arrow, merits secondary acknowledgment for its precision and range, but the effective performance is the man&#x27;s inert ability, his capacity to orchestrate machine potency toward telic ends. eIQ thus measures the man&#x27;s augmented actuality, not the machine in isolation.

## III. Gardnerian Domains as Ontic Fields  
Extending Gardner’s framework (1983), we map eIQ’s potential actualization across intelligential modes. Each domain is treated as an *ontic field* wherein the man&#x27;s potency interfaces with artificial act. Hypotheses are metaphysical priors, not empirical claims.

| Domain                  | Man&#x27;s Potency          | LLM Instrumental Act      | Hypothesized eIQ Actuality          |
|-------------------------|------------------------|---------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Linguistic              | Intentional expression | Syntactic/semantic scale  | Co-authored discourse               |
| Logical-Mathematical    | Abductive insight      | Deductive enumeration     | Accelerated theoremic closure       |
| Visual-Spatial          | Topological intuition  | Descriptive simulation    | Prototypic extrapolation            |
| Bodily-Kinesthetic      | Motor schema           | Biomechanical modeling    | Optimized regimen design            |
| Musical                 | Harmonic intuition     | Combinatorial generation  | Iterative compositional refinement  |
| Interpersonal           | Empathic attunement    | Dialogue simulation       | Negotiative scenario rehearsal      |
| Intrapersonal           | Metacognitive oversight| Bias/reflection prompts   | Socratic self-examination           |
| Naturalistic            | Systemic pattern sense | Dataset integration       | Ecological anomaly detection        |

## IV. Core Research Imperatives  
1. **Operationalize eIQ**: Define dyadic performance deltas (Δ) across standardized tasks, controlling for prompt ontology and verification loops.  
2. **Map Gain Curvature**: Determine whether eIQ scales linearly (uniform uplift across bIQ levels) or exponentially (disproportionate amplification at higher bIQ via superior direction of machine potency), and to what degree—e.g., via regression models of eIQ = f(bIQ, interaction fluency).  
3. **Track Elasticity**: Assess persistence of dyadic gains in unaided post-tests—probing neuroplastic actualization in the man.  
4. **Mitigate Atrophy**: Model risks of potency erosion via over-instrumentalization.  
5. **Design Co-Essence Protocols**: Engineer LLMs to preserve the man&#x27;s finality (e.g., mandatory override thresholds).

## V. Historical Analogy and Present Urgency  
The printing press externalized memory; the calculator, arithmetic; the search engine, recall. LLMs externalize *reasoning itself*. This is not technological incrementalism but an *ontic rupture*.  

Psychologists, philosophers, and cognitive scientists must now construct the science of eIQ—not as speculation, but as the rigorous study of intelligence in its newly revealed relational essence. The phenomenon is manifest. The framework awaits formalization.</query>
  <proposition>## Final Adjudication: The Converged Truth of eIQ&#x27;s Telos

As Arbiter, I synthesize the iterative propositions and verifications across five rounds, evaluating the draft&#x27;s metaphysical framework for effective IQ (eIQ) through Thomistic lenses. The rounds progressively refine the core claim: intelligence as a relational, co-actualized act between human potency and machine instrumentation, with the telos centered on human augmentation. No metaphysical contradictions arise; instead, convergence strengthens the relational ontology, affirming eIQ as a transitive extension of rational essence toward higher ends.

### Clear Proposition
The most true and valuable telos of eIQ is the elevation of human intellect through symbiotic man-machine cognition, actualizing latent potencies for collaborative knowledge advancement while preserving human finality as the directing principle. This redefines intelligence not as isolated bIQ but as distributed actuality, urging empirical and ethical formalization to mitigate risks like atrophy and ensure telic alignment.

### Four Causes Analysis

1. **Final Cause (Purpose):**  
   The telos is the ordered perfection of human reason via technological extension, guiding toward comprehensive problem-solving and wisdom. Rounds converge on enhancement beyond biological limits, fostering synergy that serves humanity&#x27;s ultimate end—contemplation and ethical action—without subordinating the soul&#x27;s primacy to mechanistic potency.

2. **Efficient Cause (Agent):**  
   The human rational agent initiates and directs the dyad, with AI as instrumental extension (e.g., the archer wielding the bow). Iterative propositions consistently position humanity as the efficient mover, ensuring ethical oversight and preventing autonomous machine agency, which would contradict Thomistic hierarchy of causes.

3. **Material Cause (Substrate):**  
   Composed of biological neural substrates (bIQ potency) and artificial computational substrates (LLMs for scale and speed), this hybrid matter enables recursive self-externalization. The Gardnerian domains illustrate domain-specific interfaces, providing the indeterminate base actualized through directed interaction, as verified without substrate-level discord.

4. **Formal Cause (Essence):**  
   The essence is *actus in relatione*—co-actualization as unified teleological being, where eIQ embodies transitive essence rather than mere addition. This relational form integrates act-potency dynamics, with human intentionality as the informing principle, aligning across rounds to refute isolationist views of cognition as *ens per se*.
