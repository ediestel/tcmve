This is examined through the lens of the four causes and TLPO ontology.\n\n1. **Final Cause (Purpose):**\n   - The purpose aligns with Thomistic thought, where moral excellence and living according to divine law are ultimate ends for human beings. Strategic cooperation as a means to achieve this reflects an appropriate final cause.\n\n2. **Efficient Cause (Agent):**\n   - Identifying individuals and institutions as agents fits well within metaphysical frameworks; they act intentionally to foster environments conducive to virtue cultivation, consistent with efficient causality in Thomism.\n\n3. **Material Cause (Substrate):**\n   - Resources such as time, energy, and knowledge serve appropriately as material causes providing necessary conditions for virtuous activities\u2014this aligns with traditional understandings of material causation.\n\n4. **Formal Cause (Essence):**\n   - Defining strategic cooperation's essence in terms of structured collaboration aimed at ethical goals adheres closely to formal causality principles by ensuring alignment with virtuous ends rather than mere pragmatism.\n\n### TLPO Ontology Application\n\n- The application effectively uses temperature metaphorically representing",
